## Telef√≥nica Full Stack Dev Challenge
Provides two ways to execute the tasks from the challenge. One version using just VanillaJS and other using PHP to handle the requests.

## JavaScript version usage
- There is no need of a server nor any configuration to use the pure JavaScript version. Just open `www/index.html` in the browser and use it.

## PHP Version Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose

*If requirements are unavailable, just copy the content of `www` folder into the public folder of you own web server and run through it*

### Install and Run PHP version

- Start containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- Access https://localhost
